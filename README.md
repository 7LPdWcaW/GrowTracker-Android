Welcome to grow tracker. This app was created to help record data about growing plants in order to monitor the growing conditions to help make the plants grow better, and identify potential issues during the grow process.

[Latest APK: (MD5) accc43f8dfff1fb51fc15c1ff54cfc6c v2.4-beta1](https://github.com/7LPdWcaW/GrowTracker-Android/releases/download/v2.4-alpha2/v2.4-alpha2-production.apk)

[Latest APK (Discrete): (MD5) 03b931b602f1619e12021292a854342c v2.4-beta1](https://github.com/7LPdWcaW/GrowTracker-Android/releases/download/v2.4-alpha2/v2.4-alpha2-discrete.apk)

You can follow development, post questions, or grow logs in the [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/growutils)

# Installation

The app requires no permissions except for external storage (for caching plant data and images) which you can see [here](https://github.com/7LPdWcaW/GrowTracker-Android/blob/develop/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml) in order for users to maintain anonymity, and a minimum Android version of `4.2` and above

# Addons

On documentation on creating addons, please see [ADDONS.md](ADDONS.md)

# About the app

The app uses a simple JSON structure to store all the data about the plants that can be found in `/sdcard/Android/data/me.anon.grow/files/plants.json`. All photos taken in the app are stored in `/sdcard/DCIM/GrowTracker/` in the corresponding plant id folder. `NOTE`: Photos will **not** show in any gallery app and will only be accessible through GrowTracker, or other **file** browser apps such as `ESFile Explorer`

The structure is very simple. Note: date timestamps are all unix timestamps from 1/1/1970 in milliseconds. All objects in arrays are in date order, where index 0 is the oldest and index (size - 1) is the newest.

### Plant object

- Plant date in milliseconds

```
{
    "id": <String>,
    "actions": [<Action Object>],
    "images": [<String>],
    "name": "test",
    "strain": "test",
    "clone": <boolean>,
    "medium": <Medium>,
    "mediumDetails": <String>,
    "plantDate": 1234567890
}
```

### Medium (ENUM)

One of,

`SOIL`, `HYDRO`, `COCO`, `AERO`

### Plant Stage (ENUM)

One of,

`PLANTED`, `GERMINATION`, `CUTTING`, `VEGETATION`, `FLOWER`, `DRYING`, `CURING`, `HARVESTED`

### Action object (feeding)

Temperature measured in ºC


### Action object (water)

- Temperature measured in ºC
- Amount measured in ml
- Date is milliseconds

Water action for waterings

```
{
    "additives": [<Additive>],
    "ph": <Double>,
    "ppm": <Long>,
    "runoff": <Double>,
    "amount": <Double>,
    "date": 1431268453111,
    "type": "Water",
    "temp": <Double>
}
```

### Additive object - used for nutrients

- Amount is measured in ml

```
{
    "description": <String>,
    "amount": <Double>
}
```

### Action object (other)

Action can be one of,

`FIM`, `FLUSH`, `FOLIAR_FEED`, `LST`, `LOLLIPOP`, `PESTICIDE_APPLICATION`, `TOP`, `TRANSPLANTED`, `TRIM`

- Date in milliseconds

```
{
    "action": <Action>,
    "date": 1431258118968,
    "type": "Action"
}
```

### Stage change

- Date in milliseconds

```
{
    "newStage": <Plant Stage>,
    "date": 1431258118968,
    "type": "StageChange"
}
```

### Note

- Date in milliseconds

```
{
    "notes": <String>,
    "date": 1431258118968,
    "type": "Note"
}
```

Image object is a simple string path to an image. Each image is named by the timestamp when it was taken, in milliseconds.

# Encryption

Note that this is **not** a guarantee form of encryption from law enforcement agencies.

Encryption in the app uses basic AES for encryption using the provided passphrase. If the passphrase is less than 128 bits (16 UTF-8 chars), it will be padded with `0x0` bytes. You can view the key generator method [here](https://github.com/7LPdWcaW/GrowTracker-Android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/me/anon/lib/helper/EncryptionHelper.java#L27)

You can decrypt your files using your passphrase either by writing a script that uses AES decryption, or an online tool such as [Online-Domain-Tools](http://aes.online-domain-tools.com/).
